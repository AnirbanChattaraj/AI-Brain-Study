🧠 AI & Short Videos – Long-Term Brain Impact Study

A modern, responsive educational web project that explores how AI-driven short-form content (Reels, Shorts, TikTok-style platforms) impacts the human brain over time.

This project highlights attention span decline, dopamine dependency, cognitive rewiring, and memory effects using an interactive, premium UI design.

🚀 Live Concept

“Understanding technology before it understands us.”

This website demonstrates how algorithm-driven short videos influence:

🧠 Attention span

⚡ Dopamine cycles

📉 Memory retention

🔁 Behavioral conditioning

🧩 Decision fatigue

🎨 Design System
Color Palette Used

rgb(250, 92, 92) – Primary Accent (Energy / Urgency)

rgb(253, 138, 107) – Secondary Gradient

rgb(254, 194, 136) – Soft Highlight

rgb(251, 239, 118) – Warm Background Tone

The color psychology reflects stimulation, digital overload, and cognitive alertness.
